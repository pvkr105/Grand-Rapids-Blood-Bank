         <h3 class="section-heading">Explore and learn how to help yourself and help save others, every day.</h3>
         <p>Each day, thousands of people – people just like you – provide compassionate care to those in need. Our network of generous donors, volunteers and employees share a mission of preventing and relieving suffering, here at home and around the world.</p>
         <p>We roll up our sleeves and donate time, money and blood. We learn or teach life-saving skills so our communities can be better prepared when the need arises. We do this every day because the Red Cross is needed - every day.</p>
         <h2 class="section-heading">Because of You, Life Doesn’t Stop.</h2>
         <p>Every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood. This could be a little girl in the ICU or a mother with Stage 3 leukemia. If you’re worried about needles, don’t be—most blood donors compare the experience to a mild, split-second pinch! The entire process is very safe and very fast, and you will feel amazing knowing you potentially saved up to three people.</p>

         <h2 class="section-heading">The Benefits of Donating Blood.</h2>
         <p>Donating blood has benefits for your emotional and physical health. According to a report by the Mental Health Foundation, helping others can:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>reduce stress</li>
         <li>improve your emotional well-being</li>
         <li>benefit your physical health</li>
         <li>help get rid of negative feelings</li>
         <li>provide a sense of belonging and reduce isolation</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Research has found further evidence of the health benefits that come specifically from donating blood.</p>

         <h3 class="section-heading">During the donation</h3>
         <p>You must register to donate blood. This includes providing identification, your medical history, and undergoing a quick physical examination. You’ll also be given some information about blood donation to read.</p>
         <p>Once you’re ready, your blood donation procedure will begin. Whole blood donation is the most common type of donation. This is because it offers the most flexibility. It can be transfused as whole blood or separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma for different recipients.</p>
         <p>For a whole blood donation procedure:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>You’ll be seated in a reclining chair. You can donate blood either sitting or lying down.</li>
            <li>A small area of your arm will be cleaned. A sterile needle will then be inserted.</li>
            <li>You’ll remain seated or lying down while a pint of your blood is drawn. This takes 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When a pint of blood has been collected, a staff member will remove the needle and bandage your arm.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Once your donation is complete, you’ll be given a snack and a drink and be able to sit and rest for 10 or 15 minutes before you leave. If you feel faint or nauseous, you’ll be able to lie down until you feel better.</p>
         
         
         <p>All healthy donors are urged to donate now; if you’ve had COVID-19 and have been symptom-free for 10 days, you are eligible to donate. Whatever your COVID-19 vaccination status, you are ABSOLUTELY allowed to give blood or platelets.</p>
